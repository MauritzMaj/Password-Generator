# Password Generator Starter Code


## Description

For this assignment I used the started code given to us  to build a password generator. 

## Usage

First the user is aksed to specify a length anywhere between 8 and 128 characters.
next the user is asked to confirm the inclusion of 4 different character sets:

- Upper Case
- Lower Case
- Numbers
- Special Characters.

Based on the user input a random password is then generated.

Please see screenshot below of generator in use:
